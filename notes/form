form holds the widgets and keeps track of what has focus


#focus is centered to a fixed location on screen.
#all other objects need an absolute position to subtract from an offset.
#start at 0,0 offset and 0,0 initial textbox.
#when another textbox is added, it takes the old absolute height of the previous branch + lines as its absolute.
#the new text is then focused to, and the difference between its absolute and centered position is the offset.
#the offset is then applied to all other objects on the form.

form needs to refresh on line add

how to cascade all widgets to re-evaluate their caller's POS.


Branch:
-body
-tail

when a new branch is created, the user is saying whether it should be a body or tail.

why not run cascade inside draw seek? just set a global bool when shift is needed.

when cascading, a branch needs to know what index it is, and the accumulative height of each sibling.
#seek self, @parent, true
#parent.children.each do |x|
#       x.shift height
#       height += x.pos.h


line delete must remove height from branch and nlo
