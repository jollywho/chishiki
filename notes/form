form holds the widgets and keeps track of what has focus


#focus is centered to a fixed location on screen.
#all other objects need an absolute position to subtract from an offset.
#start at 0,0 offset and 0,0 initial textbox.
#when another textbox is added, it takes the old absolute height of the previous branch + lines as its absolute.
#the new text is then focused to, and the difference between its absolute and centered position is the offset.
#the offset is then applied to all other objects on the form.
