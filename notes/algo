#start at top and render down?

1) if top.inbounds == 0, remove top from list.
2) if top is in bounds, and top.parent.inbounds > 0, move one parent back and goto 1.

1) for each child seek until out of bounds.
2) if in bounds, add +1 to parent.inbounds, then repeat 1 for children.

**inital branch cannot have peers**
__________________________________________________________

from initial branch, render until inbound count reaches 0

when following child branches, add to parent.inbound for each hop.

# calc bounds after reaching a 0 count node?

creating a new peer should be inserting below parent, not below focus.
the insert should cause a line addition.
why doesn't line addition cause the lines below to bump?


#branches calculate CIB during seek based on whether they are onscreen or not.
#these add their string to Screen's list of string objects and positions.
#if a string is clipped on screen bounds, it gets split based on how it is offsceen.
##textbox lines with strings too long will wrap by default. this is a problem!
##the textbox should not be resized to fit. it should be cropped line labels.
##resizing the height would cascade down the branch chain.

#have focus branch's pipes colored differently.


#problem is growth is attached to CIB. line adds need to be separate so they can be undone.


:line growth with pipes:
#first child
#peer below you
#when the cib cascades upwards recursively on parents


#does the focus land between my target and myself? increase my amount if so.
