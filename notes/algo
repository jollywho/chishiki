#start at top and render down?

1) if top.inbounds == 0, remove top from list.
2) if top is in bounds, and top.parent.inbounds > 0, move one parent back and goto 1.

1) for each child seek until out of bounds.
2) if in bounds, add +1 to parent.inbounds, then repeat 1 for children.

**inital branch cannot have peers**
__________________________________________________________

from initial branch, render until inbound count reaches 0

when following child branches, add to parent.inbound for each hop.

# calc bounds after reaching a 0 count node?
