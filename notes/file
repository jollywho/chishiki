running the script "chishiki [file]" in normal use will mean running from a non-local context.
therefore __FILE__ will be incorrect if it is stored and run globally as an alias.

things to figure out:
-where are the files stored after deploying?
-how to make an alias part of install script/ bundle
-how to detect the PWD when the script is called globally
